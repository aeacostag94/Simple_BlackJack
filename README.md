# Simple_BlackJack
This is a simple blackjack game code, to practice the loops and functions in python. This doesn't have user interface and everything is doing for the terminal.

Next Steps to improve:

1. Let the game decide who win. The game give the results but it does not say who win, the user must to do it by he/she self.
2. Create in the deck of cards  the Letter A,K,Q and J, the game only has from 1 to 10.
3. Improve the logic of the croupier, the logic is very simple, basically if the hand of the croupier is less than 15 it play to try to take a 21.
